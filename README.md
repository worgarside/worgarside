I'm Will, a Lead DevOps Engineer who doesn't rest until I've solved whatever problem I'm faced with. A firm believer that the finer details are what makes a project that much better,  I'm always looking to make people's live easier through automation and increasing efficiency wherever possible.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on AWS stacks, mainly with Python for now
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Golang too!
- :robot: I'm an avid smart home and 3D printing enthusiast
